# KingCountyHousing

This is phase 2 project about King County Housing using Linear Regression Models.

Phase 2 Team 1 Project â€“ King County Realty

Juana Tavera, Clay Hunn, and Brendan Bruno

# Overview

This project is an analysis of the sell price for homes in King County in the Seattle area.

# Business Problem

Our goal was to analyze the key factors in the price of homes in the King County area and how strong the relationship was between them. 

# Results

After running a few regression models, we determined that the zone, and house grade were some of the largest contributing factors and could better help determine whether a house was over or under priced based on the zone and grade of the house.

# Conclusion

We determined certain conditions would be advantagous for King County Realty to know such as whether or not a suburban house priced at $180 was above or below market value and whether it should be sold at a higher price.
